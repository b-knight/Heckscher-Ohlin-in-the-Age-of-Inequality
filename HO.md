&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what extent do patterns of global trade explain increasing economic inequality within developed economies? Depending on one's preferred measure, inequality has been upward trending in the United States since the 1980s, or as far back as the 1960s (see <font color="red">Figure 1</font> ). Economists continue to debate the costs (Kumhof and Ranciere 2010), benefits (Forbes 2000), and necessity (Okun 1975) of economic inequality. However, the U.S. public has become increasingly pessimistic towards inequality, regardless of any associated benefits. In a recent NBC-WSJ poll, 54% of Americans interviewed agreed that "The widening gap between the incomes of the wealthy and everyone else is undermining the idea that every American has the opportunity to move up to a better standard of living" (Cillizza 2014). This is despite the fact that the stock market has enjoyed a robust recovery from the 2007-08 financial crisis (Menton 2014). 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent works on economic inequality have sought to leverage new historical data to identify inequality's fundamental causes (Piketty 2014). However, in addition to assessing the explanatory power of the new literature, it may be prudent to reexamine the pre-existing theoretical framework in light of the most recent data. In the following paper I lay forth a series of empirical tests designed to assess the Heckscher-Ohlin model`s ability to account for rising economic inequality within the developed world.

### Testing for Stolper-Samuelson Effects in an Era of Inequality
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model of international trade represents a formalization of David Ricardo's classic theory of comparative advantage (1933). Suppose that there are two countries - country A and country B, and that each country is endowed with varying amounts of two different factors of production - let us call them capital and labor. Following the mechanism of comparative advantage, countries A and B specialize in the good that utilizes the relatively abundant factor of production. Thus, if country A is rich in capital, it will specialize in capital-intensive goods which it will subsequently export to country B. In contrast, country B is relatively rich in labor, and will tend to export labor-intensive goods to country A. 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we assume constant returns and perfect competition, then the H-O model should produce what are known as Stolper-Samuelson effects. Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson predicted that as the demand for a particular good increases, the returns for factors utilized in the production of that good should increase as well (1941). Thus, when a developing country becomes able to export to developed economies, that country should experience an increase in demand for labor-intensive goods. Prices for labor-intensive goods should increase in turn (assuming that prices correlate with demand). Consequently, the returns to labor (i.e. wages) should increase as well. Conversely, when capital abundant economies such as the U.S. export capital-intensive goods to the developing world, we should expect in an increase in the returns to capital (greater profits, dividends, etc.). 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Stolper-Samuelson effects manifest as predicted, then increasing trade between the developed and developing world may explain increasing economic inequality in the former. Specifically, imports from the developing world should drive down the returns to labor (thus curtailing the income of wage earners within the developed world) while exports to the developing world should increase the returns to capital (thus further enriching the owners of capital). 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As intuitive as the logic may be, there is no shortage of controversy as to whether Stolper-Samuelson effects actually exist today. In an early attempt to test the implications of the H-O model, Wassily Leontief found that the capital-abundant U.S. was, counterintuitively,  exporting labor-intensive goods while importing capital-intensive goods (1954). In a highly influential article, Paul Krugman presented a parsimonious model explaining the forces underlying the Leontief paradox and why, in the wake of WWII, the developed world did not appear to experience the stagnating wages that the H-O model predicts (1981). Nearly three decades later, Krugman reversed his argument, noting that developing countries were increasingly specializing in unskilled, labor-intensive niches, resulting in "textbook" Stolper-Samuelson effects (2008). Only two years prior, Donald R. Davis and Prachi Mishra had noted rising wage inequality within Latin America following trade liberalization, arguing that "It is time to declare Stolper-Samuelson dead" (2007).
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Stolper-Samuelson effects are at work today, then we should expect international arbitrage to exert an effect on both the returns for labor and capital, with economic inequality increasing in the developed world versus decreasing within the developing world. In theory, the nature of the economic exchange should not matter. When a richer country *R* trades with a poorer country *P*, trade in both directions should produce the predicted effect. Thus, exports *R*$\rightarrow$*P* should widen economic inequality within *R* by benefiting *R*'s top income earners, and imports *R*$\leftarrow$*P* should widen economic inequality by undermining *R*'s lower income earners.

### Dependent Variables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use three different measures for the dependent variable of economic inequality: two different sets of Gini coefficients, and the Theil index. Table 2 presents a correlation matrix of these three measures, while the reader can visually assess the different measures by looking at the different trends for the U.S. presented in <span style="color:red">Figure 1</span>. 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economists calculate Gini coefficients by using estimates of the Lorenz curve, the Lorenz curve being the hypothetical difference in distributions of wealth between a uniform distribution versus the actual distribution for county *i*. In turn, a Gini coefficient is the ratio of area enclosed by the Lorenz curve divided by the total area under the uniform distribution. Formally, 
![Insert caption here](./Equation_1.png)                                                               
where *A* is the area enclosed by the Lorenz curve, and *B* represents the uniform distribution (i.e. a hypothetical society of perfect inequality). For data, I use the [World Income Inequality Database (WIID)](http://www.wider.unu.edu/research/WIID3-0B/en_GB/database/) V3.0B hosted by the United Nations University - World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) (September 2014). Based upon previous work by Klaus Deininger and Lyn Squire (1996, 1998), the UNU-WIDER dataset contains 7,054 Gini coefficient estimates from 175 states and political entities dating as far back as 1867 (n = 2,821). The dataset lists multiple coefficient estimates per country/year, and assigns each estimate a score on a [1, 4] scale of quality. In preparing the data for analysis, I average together all Gini coefficients across country/year/quality assessments. I then drop the lowest quality coefficients in instances where multiple estimates remain. The summary statistics for the resulting dataset are displayed in Table 1.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no internationally agreed upon standard for the income / consumption data that underlies the construction of these estimates. The UNU-WIDER dataset encompasses different surveys, income / consumption concepts, population concepts, weighting procedures, and so forth. Scrubbing the dataset of the lowest quality estimates alleviates the problem, but does not tackle the fundamental problem of comparability across countries. James Galbraith and Hyunsub Kum note that conventional studies utilizing the Deininger and Squire data show great variation in economic inequality within the Euro Region, but far less variation across countries such as India and Indonesia (2004). The extent of economic integration is far greater in Europe than in South and Southeast Asia, and so we should expect the variance of Gini coefficients to be less within Europe than without. Galbraith and Kum suggest that the fact that the opposite appears to be the case is *prima facie* evidence against the integrity of the Deininger and Squire estimates, and by extension, good reason to treat the UNU-WIDER data with skepticism. 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address these concerns, I supplement the UNU-WIDER data with the [Estimated Household Income Inequality (EHII)](http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/data.html) dataset hosted by the University of Texas Inequality Project (UTIP). Unlike UNU-WIDER, UTIP uses the Theil Index as opposed to Gini coefficients. Formally, 
![Insert caption here](./Equation_2.png)                                                             
where *n* is the number of individuals within the country of interest, $x_i$ is each individual citizen, and $\bar{x}$ is the mean wealth per citizen (i.e. GDP per capita). The above expression implies that in a hypothetical situation where citizen *i* holds 100\% of the country's wealth, the Theil Index will be equal to the natural log of *i*'s wealth divided by the GDP per capita (the term in parentheses). Similar to a Gini coefficient, the Theil Index estimates the difference between a country's actual distribution of wealth versus a uniform distribution from a perfectly egalitarian country.  Galbraith and Kum have compiled a dataset of Theil Index estimates comprising 6,900 county/years. After discounting missing data, we are left with 3,918 observations - a significant improvement over the UN-WIDER data.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my third measure, I turn to the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). Despite its relatively recent publication, multiple articles citing SWIID have appeared in such journals as *Social Science Quarterly* and *Political Research Quarterly*. SWIID works by synthesizing the UNU-WIDER dataset together with other datasets such as the OECD Income Distribution Database, Eurostat, the World Bank, and statistical offices around the world (Solt 2014). Using a form of imputation, SWIID leverages information from proximate years within the same country to estimate Gini coefficients that are missing from the UNU-WIDER data. The result is that SWIID maximizes the comparability of estimates while expanding coverage to 174 countries from the years 1960-2013 (n = 4,627), providing the largest available coverage among the three measures of economic equality discussed here (see <span style="color:red">Table 1</span>).<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 

### Independent Variables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study examines the extent to which Stolper-Samuelson effects can account for economic inequality within the developed world. The causal mechanism can manifest in either one, or both of two ways: the *de facto* importation of labor (i.e., imports from poorer countries) or equally, the exportation of capital (i.e., exports to poorer countries). To operationalize the independent variables, I adopt a 2 x 2 approach, decomposing the casual mechanism into exports to developing countries (Exports$^p_{t}$), exports to developed countries (Exports$^r_{t}$), imports from developing countries (Imports$^p_{t}$), and imports from developed countries (Imports$^r_{t}$). These are all relative measures, as we are less interested in the absolute amount of trade than the relative influence trade has given the size of country *i*'s economy. Thus, I divide each of these four measure by the size of country *i*'s economy at year *t*. The resulting four measures are shown below.

I fill out the above measures by using data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF dataset encompasses 188 countries and other political entities, spans the period of 1948-2013, and contains over 1.5 million observations after discounting for missing data.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The unit of measurement is country/year/trade direction, with separate observations denoting a dyad's imports versus exports.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Figure 2 shows the distributions for the logged imports and exports weighted by GDP valued at purchasing-power-parities.

The following IMF codes were dropped from the summary statistics and analysis: 1-World; 50-APEC; 80-Export earnings: fuel;  92-Export earnings: nonfuel; 110-Advanced Economies; 170-Europe; 198-South African Common Customs Area (SACCA); 200-Emerging and Developing Countries; 205-Western Hemisphere; 349-Martinique; 353-Netherlands Antilles; 399-Western Hemisphere not specified; 405-	Middle East; 406-Middle East and North Africa; 440-Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; 505-Emerging and Developing Asia; 603-	South African Common Customs Area (SACCA), 605-Africa; 608-SACCA excluding South Africa; 626-Asia not specified; 696-Reunion; 799-Africa not specified; 816-Faroe Islands; 839-French Territories: New Caledonia; 884-Europe not specified; 887-French Territories: French Polynesia; 892-Oceania not specified; 898-Countries \& Areas, not specified; 901-CIS; 903-Emerging and Developing Europe; 910-Other Countries n.i.e.; 995-Euro Area (WEO); and 998-European Union.<a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<br> 
<sup id="fn1">5. It bears noting that the data is not perfectly symmetrical (country A's exports to country B do not equal country B's imports from country A), hence the need for separate observations. This asymmetry can be due to a variety of reasons including transportation lags (exports are recorded in one year, while the corresponding imports are not recorded until the next), the underreporting of investment income (i.e. tax evasion), asymmetric valuation (where the export and import of the same good are valued at different prices), and issues of data quality.<a href="#ref5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
