        To what extent do patterns of global trade explain increasing economic inequality within developed economies? 
Depending on one's preferred measure, inequality has been upward trending in the United States since the 1980s, or as 
far back as the 1960s. Economists continue to debate the costs (Kumhof and Ranciere 2010), benefits (Forbes 2000), and necessity (Okun 1975) of economic inequality. However, the U.S. public has become increasingly pessimistic towards inequality, regardless of any associated benefits. In a recent NBC-WSJ poll, 54% of Americans interviewed agreed that ``The widening gap between the incomes of the wealthy and everyone else is undermining the idea that every American has the opportunity to move up to a better standard of living" (Cillizza 2014). This is despite the fact that the stock market has enjoyed a robust recovery from the 2007-08 financial crisis (Menton 2014). 
        
        Recent works on economic inequality have sought to leverage new historical data to identify inequality's fundamental causes (Piketty 2014). However, in addition to assessing the explanatory power of the new literature, it may be prudent to reexamine the pre-existing theoretical framework in light of the most recent data. In the following paper I lay forth a series of empirical tests designed to assess the Heckscher-Ohlin model's ability to account for rising economic inequality within the developed world.
