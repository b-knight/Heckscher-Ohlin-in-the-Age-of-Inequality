where *A* is the area enclosed by the Lorenz curve, and *B* represents the uniform distribution (i.e. a hypothetical society of perfect inequality). For data, I use the [World Income Inequality Database (WIID)](http://www.wider.unu.edu/research/WIID3-0B/en_GB/database/) V3.0B hosted by the United Nations University - World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) (September 2014). Based upon previous work by Klaus Deininger and Lyn Squire (1996, 1998), the UNU-WIDER dataset contains 7,054 Gini coefficient estimates from 175 states and political entities dating as far back as 1867 (n = 2,821). The dataset lists multiple coefficient estimates per country/year, and assigns each estimate a score on a [1, 4] scale of quality. In preparing the data for analysis, I average together all Gini coefficients across country/year/quality assessments. I then drop the lowest quality coefficients in instances where multiple estimates remain. The summary statistics for the resulting dataset are displayed in Table 1.[^1]
